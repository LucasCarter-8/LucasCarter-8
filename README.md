--> Lucas Carter - Portfolio

My name is Lucas Carter. I am currently a second-year student at Manchester Metropolitan University studying Computer Games Development. 

I have developed a solid understanding of programming languages such as C#, C++ and Java. My coursework on databases has provided me with a great foundation in SQL and database design and I have become proficient with the Unity Game Engine. I have also had hands-on experience working in a team to design and create games and other software as part of my course.

My experience as a waiter has given me resilience and ability to work efficiently under pressure whilst multi-tasking. Furthermore, my experience as lab demonstrator and teaching assistant has helped me to consolidate my knowledge and develop my communication skills.


- Iâ€™m currently working on my Rapid Games protototyping course which requires me to design and develop a game every other week.
- I'm currently learning computer graphics as part of my course and have become enthralled by the complex math and C++ needed to create graphics using OpenGL.

Repositories:

- https://github.com/LucasCarter-8/RGP-Theme-1-Project---Lucas-Carter-23636298

This repository was for my first game in my Rapid Game Prototyping unit, here I experiented with a unique concept for a puzzle game and developed generic scripts that I could use for future projects. I managed to effectively use the time period to create a fun experience that recieved great feedback.

This repository was for my second game in my Rapid Game Prototyping unit. I had learned from my first game and refined my ideas to deliver a very different but engaging experience. I developed more generic scripts, such as a weapon controller using scriptable objects, that would be easily reusable in future projects.
  
- https://github.com/Archie-D-Murray/Team-Project

This was a repository that I worked on as part of a team for my Team Project unit. We successfully designed and developed our ideal utilising industry standard methodolgies. The game was designed as an introduction to a genre, I primarily worked on enemy AI, the player controller as well as animations.

This project was a game that I developed in my first year. I developed a unique action game that utilised complex mechanics to deliver an engaging experience. I also developed a rudimentary save system alongside all the assets for the game. This project showcased my ability and allowed me to achieve 100% in my Craft Of Game Development unit.
