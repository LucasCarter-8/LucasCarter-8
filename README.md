##Lucas Carter - Portfolio

My name is Lucas Carter. I am currently a second-year student at Manchester Metropolitan University studying Computer Games Development. 

I have developed a solid understanding of programming languages such as C#, C++ and Java. My coursework on databases has provided me with a great foundation in SQL and database design and I have become proficient with the Unity Game Engine. I have also had hands-on experience working in a team to design and create games and other software as part of my course.

My experience as a waiter has given me resilience and ability to work efficiently under pressure whilst multi-tasking. Furthermore, my experience as lab demonstrator and teaching assistant has helped me to consolidate my knowledge and develop my communication skills.


- Iâ€™m currently working on my Rapid Games protototyping course which requires me to design and develop a game every other week.
- I'm currently learning computer graphics as part of my course and have become enthralled by the complex math and C++ needed to create graphics using OpenGL.
